# RDL (Reel Downloader)

RDL (short for Reel Downloader) is a cross-platform lightweight application (currently supporting Windows and Linux) designed to download reels. Built with modern technologies, RDL offers a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Runs on both Windows and Linux.
- **Original reel download**: Fetch and download the original video.
- **Separate audio/video download**: Download the video and audio separately.
- **Chromium-based scraping**: Uses chromedp to scrape reel pages.
- Automatic browser detection.
- Detects existing Chromium-based browsers on the system.
- If none is found, download a `chromium-headless-shell` to a local cache.
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\chromedp\`
  - Linux: `~/.cache/chromedp/`
- **Dark-themed UI**: Built with Svelte, the UI offers a sleek design and enhanced user experience.
